            <!-- Moving In -->
            <h2>Moving In</h2>
            <p>
                Your WOW Week kicks off with your designated move-in day. The college will be buzzing with energy as our dedicated Frep team welcomes you to 
                your new home. They'll be on hand to answer any questions, help with anything you need, and ensure that the atmosphere is lively and

            <!--The Week-->
            <h2>A Week Full of Excitement and Tradition</h2>
            <p>
                Once you've moved in, get ready for a week packed with activities designed to give you a true Josephine Butler welcome. 
                You'll participate in the Durham University Matriculation ceremony at the Cathedral, where you'll officially be registered 
                as a university student. We'll also host our own special college Matriculation where you'll have the opportunity to 
                take photos around college and take part in our scavenger hunt!
                <br>
                Throughout the week, we'll host essential talks introducing you to key college figures and providing important information about 
                living in college. You'll also attend a JCR (Junior Common Room) meeting, where you can learn how the student body is run and 
                even have a say in how the JCR operates.

            <h2>After Freshers</h2>
            <p>
                Throughout the year, many events are out there, including formals (which includes themed ones, such as murder mystery!),
                our Winter Ball & Summer Ball, and Butler Day. We may also have more events throughout the year, such as festive celebrations
                from the international committee!

                There are societies and sports at a university level, but our college also has some of its own localised societies, sports, and committees.
                You will be able to access <a href="https://josephine.butlerjcr.com">the intranet</a> if you have already got a university email address and a CIS
                code (the abcd12 format code) to view more details, including contacts, but a snapshot
                is available at the <a href="/groups">student groups page</a>.
